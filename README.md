<h1>Superhero Search</h1>

**This app was made using Typescript, React, Redux, SASS and a Superhero API (found here: http://superheroapi.com/). By default it loads a page showing Batman characters from different comic universes. The user can then search for a superhero using the bar at the top and all superheroes with that search query in their name will be returned. The API returns an image of the character along with various pieces of information about them. The user can then click on the specific hero to view more information about the character.**
